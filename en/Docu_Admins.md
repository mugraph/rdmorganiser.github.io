# Help / Guide / Documentation for RDMO Admins

There are three different roles within RDMO: [User]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/Docu_User), [Manager]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/Docu_Manager) and [Admins]({{ site .baseurl }}/en/Docu_Admins).<br/>
As a <b>admin</b> you have the option:

* Complete customisation of the user interface

    * Layout
* Integration into the local infrastructure
    * Authorisation and authentication
    * APIs

<b>Software</b>
RDMO is implemented as a web application. It is available as open-source software on [github.com](https://github.com/rdmorganiser). Our main use case is the collaborative collecting, editing and maintenance of all necessary information for a sustainable data management. This is done along the notion of *projects*, which will be defined by the users for their particular context.
The main functionality of RDMO includes the following features:

## Development

For the further development of RDMO, we use a roadmap process in which the existing issues on GitHub are prioritised by the community. In 2022, a large number of issues were prioritised into `critical`, `high`, `medium` and `low` in two community meetings. The best way to view the individual lists is on GitHub, under these links:

* [Critical](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+critical%22)
* [High](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+high%22)
* [Medium](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+medium%22)
* [Low](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22priority%3A+low%22)

To transparently communicate the status of the work in progress, we use the "Projects" functionality of GitHub, where the individual issues are displayed on a [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board):

<https://github.com/orgs/rdmorganiser/projects/1>

New feature requests, bug reports or security issues are best suggested or reported via GitHub Issue:

<https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo/issues/new/choose>

Of course, we also accept requests via all other communication channels.
